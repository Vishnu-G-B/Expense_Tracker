# Expense_Tracker
This is a repository for my CBSE 12th grade final project. It is an expense tracker made using python, MySQL and Tkinter. Tkinter was used to create the GUI and MySQL and python was used to create the backend storage of the expense data and the methods to add, delete, modify and repeat expenses.

Pre-requisites:
1) MySQL must be installed.
2) python must be installed.

TO EXECUTE THIS PROJECT IN YOUR OWN SYSTEM:
1) DOWNLOAD/COPY THE ExpensetrackerGUI,GUIFunctions and init files onto your system.
2) DOWNLOAD all the neccessary dependancies.
3) DOWNLOAD images in the images folder.
4) RUN the ExpensetrackerGUI file on your system and hopefully it should work.
Once the program is running it should on the inital startup ask for your MySQL username and password, the username should always be root if you have MySQL running on your machine and password is the password set by you when you set up MySQL.
Once these steps are finished the program should run as intended
