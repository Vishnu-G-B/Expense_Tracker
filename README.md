# Expense_Tracker
This is a repository for my CBSE 12th grade final project. It is an expense tracker made using python, MySQL and Tkinter. Tkinter was used to create the GUI and MySQL and python was used to create the backend storage of the expense data and the methods to add, delete, modify and repeat expenses.
